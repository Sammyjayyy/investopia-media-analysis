## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The project started with two datasets:
- **Traditional Media Mentions**
- **Social Media Mentions**

Key cleaning steps:
- Replaced `null` values:
  - `Spokesperson` → “Not Provided”
  - `Third Party Commentary` → “Not Provided”
- Removed duplicates
- Handled missing values in `Ad Rate`, `Frequency`
- Normalized inconsistent handles (e.g., `investopia_ae` vs `investopia-ae`)
- Created a custom **Date Table** to enable monthly grouping
- Split multi-value `Themes` column into separate rows for proper aggregation
- Dropped irrelevant fields like `Link`, `Tags`, `Sentiment` (for traditional)
